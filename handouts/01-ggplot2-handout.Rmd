```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

Suppose we have the following toy data set, named `df`. The first two columns are numeric while the third column is categorical.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(x1 = c(1, 7, 4, "..."),
  x2 = c(3, 20, 2, "..."),
  cat1 = c("Yes", "Yes", "No", "..."))

library(pander)
pander(df)
```
