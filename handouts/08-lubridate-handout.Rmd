Suppose you have the following data set, named `df1`, which has various date formats, as `<chr>` variables. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(pander)
df <- tibble(date1 = c("January 14, 1992", "October 19, 1991"),
       date2 = c("1992-January-14", "1991-October-19"),
       date3 = c("01/14/1992", "10/19/1991"))
df %>% pander()
```

`dmy()`, `dym()`, `mdy()`, `myd()`, `ydm()`, `ymd()` to Convert to a `<date>`

Now suppose you have a data set, called `df2`, that has a `<date>` variable:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(date1 = mdy(date1)) %>% select(date1) %>% pander()
```

`year()`, `month()`, `mday()` `yday()`, and `wday()` to Pull Useful Variables from a `<date>`
