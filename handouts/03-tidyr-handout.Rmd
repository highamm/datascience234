Suppose we have the following toy data set, named `df`, on tennis players. The first column contains the player's max serve speed and handedness, the second contains their rank in the year 1980, and the third contains their rank in the year 1981.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(xvar = c("100-RH", "110-LH", "99-RH"),
  Rank1980 = c(2, 30, 31),
  Rank1981 = c(6, 19, 30))
library(pander)
pander(df)
```
