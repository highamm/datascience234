Use this data for the practice problems: (but untidy it first)

still a little confused on the variables here....so maybe use the tidy tuesday data set on police brutality
combined_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5harad/openpolicing/master/results/data_for_figures/combined_data.csv")

Have a long(ish) list of problems that are entirely optional. I'll answer some questions about them, but only if you've shown me substantial effort was made. I won't answer any questions about them after the midterm is given out. 

Basic In-class portion: 

Have some basic plots. Change options on one of the plots (themes, labels, etc.)

Basic data wrangling: a few filters with missings, mutate(case_when()),
group_by() and summarise(), arrange(), combining all of these with a pipe.

Basic data tidying: using separate() and unite(), using pivot_longer() or pivot_wider()

R Markdown: creating tables, using the chunk options, using the text options
